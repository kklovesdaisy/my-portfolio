/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  PORTFOLIO CONFIGURATION
 *  Edit your personal information in THIS ONE FILE.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 *  Everything the website shows about you lives here, so you never have to
 *  touch a component file to personalise the portfolio.
 *
 *  HOW TO EDIT
 *  -----------
 *  1. Change any value below to your own details.
 *  2. Where noted, leave a value as "" (empty string) to hide that element.
 *     For example, `avatar`, `cv` and the project `image` / `repo` / `demo`.
 *     An empty `linkedin` hides every LinkedIn link on the site.
 *  3. Save — the site updates automatically (Vite hot-reloads while
 *     `npm run dev` is running).
 *
 *  WHAT LIVES WHERE
 *  ----------------
 *  profile     name, title, short intro, location, photo, CV, email + links
 *  navItems    the links in the top navigation bar
 *  hero        the greeting, name and role lines at the top of the page
 *  about       the "About Me" text, quick facts and info cards
 *  skills      the "Skills & Abilities" grid
 *  education   the "Education" timeline entries
 *  projects    the "Featured Projects" cards
 *  contact     the "Contact" section copy
 *
 *  Brand colours for technology chips live in src/data/techColors.js.
